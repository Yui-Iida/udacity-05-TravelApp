# Travel App Project

"Travel App Project" is the final capstone project of front-end developer nanodegree program on udacity.

## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

What I have done is:

- Setup a Node environment with Express
- Setup a server with GET and POST routes
- Use the Fetch API with my credentials and userinput to get dynamic data into my app routes
- Output propeties synamically with JavaScript
